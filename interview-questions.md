# ASSESSMENT 5: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. Compare and contrast arrays and hashes in Ruby. Include at least two differences and two similarities.

Your answer: Both can hold multiple pieces of data and can itterate through them. Hashes can hold key-value pairs and objects/symbols. While Hases cannot. 

Researched answer: Both arrays and hashes are used to store collections of data. They can store multiple values or items in a single variable, bot can also be iterated over using similar methods, such as each, map, and select. Arrays are ordered collections of elements, and each element in an array is assigned an index, starting from 0. Hashes are not ordered, which means the elements in a hash have no guaranteed order using keys instead of indexes.

2. What does it mean to implement a TTD workflow?

Your answer: To implement a TTD workflow means to test everything for a 'good' fail first, then build the code or function to  make the test pass.

Researched answer: To implement a TTD workflow means to write a Test (Red phase) to describe the expected behavior of the code. Then write the minimum code to make the test pass (Green phase). Then refactor the code (Refactor phase), to make it as clean and efficent as possible while still passing the test!

3. Why would super be used in a Ruby class?

Your answer: To call back to a method used in the original parent class (inception).

Researched answer: In Ruby, the super keyword is used to call a method in the superclass (parent class) of the current class. 

4. STRETCH: What is the difference between inheritance in JavaScript and inheritance in Ruby?

Researched answer: JS uses objects for inheritance and Ruby uses classes. Both have the same concept (inception).

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week
